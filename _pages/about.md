Hello, I am a second year PhD Physics student at Ahmedabad University. I am currently carrying out my PhD coursework. My research interests are understanding star formation in nearby galaxies, the physical processes (internal/ external) which triggers the star formation, multi-wavelength data analysis in Astronomy.  My other interests are reading, writing, coding and music.
